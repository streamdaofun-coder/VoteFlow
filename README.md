# 📖 VoteFlow Documentation  

## 🌊 Overview  
**VoteFlow** is a community-driven platform that transforms token streams into living ecosystems.  
If you already launched your coin on Pump.fun, you can extend it on VoteFlow by creating a **room** where governance and community decisions happen.  

VoteFlow combines three core ideas:  
- **Ownership** – claim and verify your room to make it official.  
- **Governance** – token holders vote and propose changes.  
- **Community Growth** – stronger verified rooms attract more users and activity.

## ⚙️ How it Works  

### 1. Create a Room  
- Any existing Pump.fun coin can be connected to VoteFlow by creating a room.  
- The room becomes the governance and community hub for that token.  

### 2. Claim & Verify  
- Connect socials (Twitter/X, Website).  
- Claim the room to show official ownership.  
- Verified rooms gain:  
  - ✅ Badge next to the name  
  - ✅ Unique border and highlight color in Explore  
  - ✅ Trust & visibility for holders and newcomers  

### 3. Explore & Engage  
- All rooms are listed in the **Explore section**.  
- Each room shows:  
  - Room name & verified status  
  - Social links  
  - Token stats (supply, holders, price, volume)  
- Users can discover trending, new, or verified rooms.  

### 4. Vote & Propose  
- Token holders can participate in governance:  

| Coins Held | Governance Right |
|------------|------------------|
| 100,000    | 1 Vote           |
| 5,000,000  | Create Proposal  |

- Voting power is proportional to coin holdings.  
- Example:  
  - 200k coins = 2 votes  
  - 1M coins = 10 votes  

### 5. Grow Together  
- As rooms gain holders, governance becomes more active.  
- Verified rooms evolve into stronger ecosystems, driven by community decisions.

## 🧩 Example User Flow  

1. Alice launches a coin on Pump.fun.  
2. She creates a room for it on VoteFlow.  
3. Alice claims the room and connects her socials.  
4. The room now shows verified with a badge + border.  
5. Bob holds 200k coins → he gains 2 votes.  
6. Carol holds 5M coins → she creates a proposal.  
7. The community votes → proposal passes → decision implemented.
