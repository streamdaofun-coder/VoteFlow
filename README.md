📖 VoteFlow Documentation
🌊 Overview

VoteFlow is a community-driven platform that transforms tokenized streams into living ecosystems.
Every user can launch a stream, claim their room, and participate in governance through votes and proposals.

VoteFlow combines three core ideas:

Simplicity – create a tokenized stream in seconds.

Ownership – claim and verify your room to make it yours.

Community Governance – token holders shape the future of each room.

⚙️ How it Works (Step by Step)
1. Create a Stream

Any user can start a new stream.

A stream automatically generates its own token (coin).

This token becomes the basis of governance power.

Streams appear in the Explore section immediately after creation.

2. Claim Your Room

The creator (or anyone holding the majority stake) can claim the room.

To claim, you connect socials (Twitter/X, Website).

Once claimed, the room becomes a verified entity within the platform.

Verification perks:

Verified badge next to the room name.

Highlighted border and unique color in Explore.

Added credibility for new users joining the room.

3. Explore & Engage

Rooms are displayed in the Explore repeater.

Each room shows:

Room name

Verified status (if applicable)

Social links (X, Website)

Token stats (supply, holders, price, volume)

Users can discover trending, new, or verified rooms.

4. Cast Your Vote

Users with at least 100,000 coins in a room gain the right to vote.

Each vote is proportional to the number of coins held.

Example: 1,000,000 coins = 10 votes.

5. Create a Proposal

To create a new proposal, a user must hold at least 5,000,000 coins.

Proposals define the future direction of a room, such as:

Feature requests

Governance decisions

Community actions

Proposals appear publicly in the room’s governance tab.

6. Grow Together

As rooms gather more holders, voting activity increases.

Verified rooms become stronger ecosystems, driven by collective action.

Over time, successful rooms can grow into autonomous communities.

📊 Governance Specifications

Voting Power

1 vote requires 100,000 coins.

Votes scale linearly with coin holdings.

Proposal Creation

Requires 5,000,000 coins.

Only holders above this threshold can initiate proposals.

Proposal Lifecycle

Draft → Submission → Community Voting → Accepted/Rejected.

Duration of voting: TBD (configurable in future updates).

Transparency

Every vote and proposal is visible to the public.

Rooms with verified status display an audit log of actions.

🧩 Example User Flow

Alice creates a stream → new token is launched.

Bob discovers it in Explore and buys coins.

Alice claims the room, connects her X + website.

The room now shows verified with a border + badge.

Bob holds 200k coins → he gains 2 votes.

Carol accumulates 5M coins → she creates a proposal: “Should we integrate Discord links?”

The community votes → proposal passes → feature is implemented.
