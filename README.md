# 📖 VoteFlow Documentation  

## 🌊 Overview  
**VoteFlow** is a community-driven platform that transforms token streams into living ecosystems.  
If you already launched your coin on Pump.fun, you can extend it on VoteFlow by creating a **room** where governance and community decisions happen.  

VoteFlow combines three core ideas:  
- **Ownership** – claim and verify your room to make it official.  
- **Governance** – token holders vote and propose changes.  
- **Community Growth** – stronger verified rooms attract more users and activity.

## ⚙️ How it Works  

### 1. Create a Room  
- Any existing Pump.fun coin can be connected to VoteFlow by creating a room.  
- The room becomes the governance and community hub for that token.  

### 2. Claim & Verify  
- Connect socials (Twitter/X, Website).  
- Claim the room to show official ownership.  
- Verified rooms gain:  
  - ✅ Badge next to the name  
  - ✅ Unique border and highlight color in Explore  
  - ✅ Trust & visibility for holders and newcomers  

### 3. Explore & Engage  
- All rooms are listed in the **Explore section**.  
- Each room shows:  
  - Room name & verified status  
  - Social links  
  - Token stats (supply, holders, price, volume)  
- Users can discover trending, new, or verified rooms.  

### 4. Vote & Propose  
- Token holders can participate in governance:  

| Coins Held | Governance Right |
|------------|------------------|
| 100,000    | 1 Vote           |
| 5,000,000  | Create Proposal  |

- Voting power is proportional to coin holdings.  
- Example:  
  - 200k coins = 2 votes  
  - 1M coins = 10 votes

## 📊 Governance Specifications  

### Voting Power  
- 1 vote requires **100,000 coins**.  
- Votes scale linearly with holdings.  

### Proposal Creation  
- Requires **5,000,000 coins**.  
- Only holders above this threshold can submit a proposal.  

### Voting Process (Step by Step)  
1. **Proposal Submission**  
   - A holder with ≥ 5M coins submits a proposal.  
   - If another proposal is active, the new one is added to the **queue**.  

2. **Active Voting Period**  
   - Each proposal stays open for **12 hours**.  
   - During this time, eligible holders can cast their votes.  
   - Voting is simple: **Yes / No** (or multiple-choice if specified).  
   - Votes are weighted by the number of coins held.  

3. **Closing & Results**  
   - After 12 hours, the proposal automatically **closes**.  
   - Results are calculated by summing all weighted votes.  
   - Outcome: **Accepted** (if Yes > No) or **Rejected**.  
   - The next proposal in the queue automatically moves into voting.  

### Transparency  
- All proposals, votes, and results are public.  
- Verified rooms display a clear **governance log** with past decisions.

## 🧩 Example User Flow  

1. Alice launches a coin on Pump.fun.  
2. She creates a room for it on VoteFlow.  
3. Alice claims the room and connects her socials.  
4. The room now shows verified with a badge + border.  
5. Bob holds 200k coins → he gains 2 votes.  
6. Carol holds 5M coins → she creates a proposal.  
7. The community votes for 12 hours.  
8. The proposal closes → results are published → the next proposal in queue starts.
